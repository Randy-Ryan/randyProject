        Before starting high school, I gained a passion for computers. I grew up jailbreaking phones
        for my friends and finding out other ways to "hack" games. I used to host my own 
        Minecraft server from home around the age of 12 and actually made about $20 from player donations! I was
        playing around with writing code in Java without even knowing it. This  part of my life was essentially 
        the "push" for me in deciding that I wanted to study computer science in college.
        <br><br><br>

        On another note, I'm a big family guy! I have 3 siblings and I'm an uncle to four niblings (neices and nephews); 
        Wyatt/Maddie, and Liam/Olivia.

        Liam is my oldest nephew and I am closer in age with him than I am with my brother, his father. A few years ago, he was diagnosed and has been 
        battling with a rare auto-immune disease called Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM). He's the lead author for his childrens book "Monstah Potion" 
        (Copies of this book are available for purchase now!). His website is <a href="https://curejm4liam.com/" id="curejm">linked here</a>, along with the
        <a href="https://www.curejm.org" id="curejm">Cure JM</a> website. These websites are very informative on what this disease
        is all about.
