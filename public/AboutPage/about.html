	<h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
	<br>
    <p>
        I grew up in Clinton, New Jersey and have been playing lacrosse practically my entire life! <br>
        I got recruited to play lacrosse at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston, Massachusetts. <br>
        I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in the Applied Mathematics field and planning to <br>
        graduate in August 2021! My "home" could be considered to be in Bluffton, South Carolina, where my <br>
        parents live with my two dogs, Shayna and Stogie.

        I started playing lacrosse when I was in first grade and just ended the final season of my career in May 2021.<br>
        I began playing as an attackman and then switched to goalie in fifth grade. I have been playing goalie ever since.<br>
        Shown below are are my roster pictures from freshman-senior year (Clearly I do not mess around come picture day).

        Prior to entering high school, I gained a passion for computers. I used to host my own <br>
        Minecraft server from home around the age of 12 and actually made about $20 from player donations! <br>
        This led into me deciding that I wanted to study computer science in college.<br><br><br>


        I am an uncle to four niblings (neices and nephews) and I love each and every one of them with <br>
        my whole heart! Wyatt & Maddie live in California with my sister and her husband. Liam & Olivia <br>
        live in Massachusetts with my brother and his wife.

        My nephew, Liam, is currently 7 years old and has been battling a super rare auto-immune<br>
        disease called Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM). His website is <a href="https://curejm4liam.com/" id="curejm">linked here</a> along with the <br>
        <a href="https://www.curejm.org" id="curejm">Cure JM</a> website too. These website are very imformative on what exactly this disease is all about<br>
        Liam is my oldest nephew and I am closer in age with him than I am with with my brother, his father. <br><br><br>
