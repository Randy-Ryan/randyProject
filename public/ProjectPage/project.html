<h4>Coders Platform</h4>

		<h2>
 				The purpose of codersPlatform is to provide a social media platform aimed towards anybody with a creative mind, but primarily aimed towards developers. 
				Plenty of people come up with ideas every day for an app, a project, a device, etc. This platform allows for somebody 
				with little to no prior coding experience to create an account and claim/promote their ideas for further development.<br><br>

				There are plenty of social media platforms available today, many of which are built towards facilitating connections between people 
				who share common interests. For example: Instagram, Twitter are very similar social media platforms. Coders platform differs from 
				these social media services because it is moreso aiming to bring the social media aspect into coding, promoting users to communicate 
				and work together on projects or promote/flex their project idea(s). <br><br>
				
				Users can create a profile where they can upload a profile picture, their username, email, and other personal information. 
				With the creation of an account, users can log in and create posts that are shown in the public feed. Users can also search for 
				other accounts within the system and view that account and their posts. <br>
