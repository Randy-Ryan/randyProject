				BusyQuizzy is a quiz hosting website, with the purpose of being a newly found source of fun and entertainment. This project was developed
				using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The goal behind the project was to create an engaging website for users to create and take quizzes. All quizzes are 
				multiple choice questions with four or less possible answers, one of these answers being the correct one. BusyQuizzy offers a user functionality
				for someone to sign up and create an account.
				<br><br>
				Users are able to earn points by answering questions correctly. Points are used to purchase Quiz Helpers, which are used to assist in choosing
				the correct answer by eliminating one wrong answer from the question. Users must have an account to view their balance and make purchases.

				Plenty of individuals come up with ideas every day for an app, a project, a device, etc. 			
 				The purpose of this app is to provide a social media platform that connects creative minds
				with interested, freelancing, developers. Coders Platform was developed in Android Studio
				using Java for back end purposes and XML for the front end.
				<br><br>
				Users are able to create a profile where they can register with a profile picture, 
				username, and email. With the creation of an account, users can log in and begin to create 
				posts that are shown in the public feed. Users can also search for other accounts within the 
				system and view that account and their posts. All account pages, including "my account," display
				all posts that were created from that users' account.  <br>
