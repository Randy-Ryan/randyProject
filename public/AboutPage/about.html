	<h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
	<br>
    <p>
        I grew up in Clinton, New Jersey and have been playing lacrosse practically my entire life!<br>
        I started playing when I was in first grade and just ended my final season in may.<br>
        Prior to entering high school, I gained a passion for computers. I hosted my own <br>
        minecraft server from home and actually made about 20$ from player donations! <br>
        This spiraled into me wanting to study computer science in college.<br>
        Shown below are are my lacrosse roster pictures from freshman-senior year.<br><br>
        <img src="../Images/fresh.jpeg" alt="home" height=300px width=260px style="border-radius: 12px; border: 2px solid black; padding: 0px;">
        <img src="../Images/soph.jpeg" alt="home" height=300px width=260px style="border-radius: 12px; border: 2px solid black; padding: 0px;"><br></br>
        <img src="../Images/junior.jpeg" alt="home" height=300px width=260px style="border-radius: 12px; border: 2px solid black; padding: 0px;">
        <img src="../Images/senior.jpeg" alt="home" height=300px width=260px style="border-radius: 12px; border: 2px solid black; padding: 0px;"><br></br>
        On a another note - I am an openly gay man and am very proud of my identity. <br>
        I went through high school and freshman year of college inside the closet, until <br>
        I chose to come out to my family and friends. This was the best decision I have ever made <br>
        and I am so thankful to have such supportive family and friends. Although I have faced <br>
        hardships throughout this process of coming out, I have learned so much and grown into <br>
        the person that my younger self had always dreamt of.
