        I grew up in Clinton, New Jersey and I've been playing lacrosse since first grade. 
        I was recruited to play goalie at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston, Massachusetts. 
        My home could be considered as Bluffton, South Carolina, where my parents recently moved to 
        and currently live with my two dogs, Shayna and Stogie.

        Before I began high school, I gained a passion for computers. I grew up jailbreaking phones
        for my friends and finding out other ways to "hack" games. I used to host my own 
        Minecraft server from home around the age of 12 and actually made about $20 from player donations! 
        This was essentially the "push" for me in deciding that I wanted to study computer science in college.
        <br><br><br>

        I have 3 siblings and I'm an uncle to four niblings (neices and nephews); Wyatt/Maddie, and Liam/Olivia. 
        My sister, Kelly, and brother, Luke, are 16+ years older than me, however I am only a few years younger 
        than my sister, Sam.

        Liam is my oldest nephew and I am closer in age with him than I am with my brother, his father. A few years ago, he was diagnosed and has been 
        battling with a rare auto-immune disease called Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM). He's the lead author for his childrens "Monstah Potion" 
        (Copies of this book are available for purchase now!). His website is <a href="https://curejm4liam.com/" id="curejm">linked here</a>, along with the
        <a href="https://www.curejm.org" id="curejm">Cure JM</a> website. These websites are very informative on what this disease
        is all about.
